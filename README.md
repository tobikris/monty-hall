Monty-Hall-Problem
==========
Moderator lets the player select one gate of three.
Behind one of them is a car, behind each other a goat.

After the player's choice the moderator opens another gate which hid a goat.
Now the play may choose whether to stick with his gate or change his decision and gate.

The moderator opens the chosen gate and the player receives his price; either a car or a goat.

This is a Javascript implementation of this *old* mathematical problem build for no clear purpose.
Just play and trick the machine/moderator!
